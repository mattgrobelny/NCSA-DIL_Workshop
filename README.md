# Day1 Notes

### Best Practices

Data prep
- Large data set --> larger data more likely to generalize
- large --> millions
- Reuse --> models should be re-useable
- Need or payoff ! ROI
- Fault tolerance
- Overfitting --> loss of generalization ( Works well on train, but inaccurate on test)
Network is too big or data set is too small

### Training, Validation, Test set (Rule of thumb %)

Training:
- Data set used to train network (60%)

Validation:
- periodically during training check (20%) --> Check for Overfitting

Test set:
- only use to evaluate progress (20%)
